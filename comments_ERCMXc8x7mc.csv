एक चीज़ अलग अलग तरीके से सिखाना , आपका तरीका  बहुत अच्छा लगा जो कि beginner को आसान बनाता है सीखने में 
और मन भी लगता है पढ़ने में 

क्योंकि कॉलेज में ज्यादातर तो बेसिक भी शिक्षक सही नहीं पढ़ा पाते हैं सिर्फ़ सिलेबस पर ध्यान रहता है  और कोडिंग का पार्ट तो  छूट ही जाता है 
क्योंकि वो सिर्फ ( variable, constant, ....... More)
बस इतना ही करा पाते हैं
